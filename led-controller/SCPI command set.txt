source voltage and measure voltage set and return DAC and ADC voltages directly without conversion.  They are intended for calibration use only.
in high light mode, measure current returns the photodiode current in milliamperes.
in low light mode, measure current returns the photodiode current in microamperes.
source current sets the desired current value in the units specified.  A (or blank) for amps, mA for milliamps and uA for microamps.
in constant current mode, source current sets the current to be sent to the LEDs. 
in constant light mode, source current sets the photodiode current that the regulator seeks to obtain.  
ECHO on/off turns terminal echo on and off.  it is off by default.
